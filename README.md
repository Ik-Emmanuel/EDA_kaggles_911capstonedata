## Project Description
This project was carried out to learn more about Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
The data used , was from the 911 calls capstone project from kaggle. it contains logs of emergency calls from people 
in different locations and their different emergencies. 

## Project Aim
Here I tried to explore the data to pull various insights such as: 
> what was the most occuring emergency.

> The  number of emergency calls from each township
 
 ## Tools 
 
 * I worked with the jupyter notebook under the anaconda packag. using python 3.6.
